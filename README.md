# Jungle Night
### VSCode Theme

![Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tweakimp/jungle-night/master/theme.png "Screenshot")

Optimized for Python.

I recommend using [FiraCode](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) with ligatures.

Unused colors are pink to spot where they are missing. Please file an issue if you spot one.

Send me feedback on [GitHub](https://github.com/tweakimp/jungle-night).
